# Hi! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="20px">

I'm Kashvi, 

- I'm currently working on taking my coding skills from positive to positive max.
 
- I'm obsessed with AI and not on the side of humans if there is ever a war. 

- I am really really passionate about Flutter but anything comes secondary to Machine Learning.

Here's how you can find me!
